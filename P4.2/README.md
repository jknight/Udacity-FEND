About
---
This code is a take-2 version of the optimized Pizza site.
I rewrote the guts of it from the ground up. 

README requirement
---
"A README file is included detailing all setps required to 
successfully run the application and outlines the optimizations that the student
made in views/js/main.js for pizza.html

All steps required to run the application
---
In your favorite browser which surely isn't IE, browse to:
- http://jknight.github.io/P4.2/dest/index.html
- http://jknight.github.io/P4.2/dest/views/pizza.html
These are all that is required to run the application.

To review the source code, please see the code in git under 
- [https://github.com/jknight/jknight.github.io/tree/master/P4.2/index.html](P4.2 on git)

Please note that the code is in two directories: src/ contains the original code and dest/ is the output
of the front-end gulp build (minification, etc.)

Optimizations made in views/js/main.js
---
- Rewrote the whole thing. Please see comments in code.
