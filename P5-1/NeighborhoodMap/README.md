# Udacity FEND:: Project 5: Neighborhood Map

## About

This project is a full screen map that has the following functionality:
1. A search bar
2. A list view
3. The map

Presumably it's supposed to use Knockout since the directions say "Download the Knockout framework."

Other requirements:
1. use google maps API
2. display map markers in a neighborhood
3. separate concerns (mvc)
4. when clicking on map marker, integrate 3rd party API (yelp, wikipedia, etc.)
5. mobile friendly
